Welcome to my personal homepage! I am Feng Zhangcheng (冯章成). Born in Ganzhou (赣州), Jiangxi (江西), China on September 1999, I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from the [School of Mathematics](https://math.seu.edu.cn/), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/) in June 2021. Currently, I am a three-year master's student at the same institution, under the guidance of [Prof. Jinde Cao](https://math.seu.edu.cn/jdc/list.htm) and [Prof. Wenying Xu](https://wenyingxu.github.io/). My research interests lie in multi-agent system, distributed optimization and games, online optimization and games, specifically focusing on algorithm design and realization.

On this site, you'll find information about my research projects, publications, and professional activities. Feel free to explore and reach out if you'd like to collaborate or discuss shared interests. Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to connecting with you!
