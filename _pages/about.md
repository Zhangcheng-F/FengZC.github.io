Welcome to my personal homepage! I am Feng Zhangcheng (冯章成). Born in Ganzhou (赣州), Jiangxi (江西), China on September 1999, I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from the [School of Mathematics](https://math.seu.edu.cn/), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/) in June 2021. Currently, I am a three-year master's student at the same institution, under the guidance of [Prof. Jinde Cao](https://math.seu.edu.cn/jdc/list.htm) and [Prof. Wenying Xu](https://wenyingxu.github.io/). My research interests lie in multi-agent system, distributed optimization and games, online optimization and games, specifically focusing on algorithm design and realization.
